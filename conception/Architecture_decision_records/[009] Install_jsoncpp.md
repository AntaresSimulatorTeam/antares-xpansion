# Install jsoncpp library with xpansion

## Status: Accepted [28 Feb. 2024]

## Context

In the context of migrating from centOS7 to oracle linux8 it was observed that managing jsoncpp library installation on
target environment
can be difficult.

## Decision

Deliver jsoncpp library with xpansion package

## Consequences

jsoncpp does not need to be installed on the target system. No version conflict
