# Data test mini_instance_UNBOUNDED

## Brief

This test case is an unbounded instance. 
It is used to test unboundedness detection at optimization level.
This test case is used by bendersEndToEnd test.

## Problem formulation

min -10 x + z1 + z2

sc.

    x + z1 >= 1.5

    x + z2 >= 2.5

    0 <= z1

    0 <= z2
