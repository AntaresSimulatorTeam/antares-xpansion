# Study format changes

This page gathers the changes in the file format of the study or its outputs. The main goal of this document is to lower the costs of changing existing interfaces, both GUI and scripts.

## v1.1

- In `user/expansion/settings.ini`, new parameter `batch_size`
- Files `reportbenderssequential.txt` and `reportbendersmpi.txt` are now called `reportbenders.txt`
