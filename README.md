# Introduction

The [Antares-Xpansion][xpansion-github] package, works along with RTE's adequacy software [Antares][antareswebsite] that is also [hosted on github][antares-github]. Antares-Xpansion aims at performing investment simulations for Antares studies. 

Please see the [Antares-Xpansion Documentation][readthedocs] for an introductory tutorial,
and a full user guide.

For developers: [here][xpansion-doxygen] you can find doxygen code documentation.

Check out the [Antares-Simulator documentation][readthedocs-antares] for more insights on Antares. 

Antares-Xpansion optimizes the investments on new capacities and transmission lines for an Antares study. Typical uses of Antares-Xpansion are for example:

- **long-term scenario building**: build an economically consistent long-term generation mix,
- **transmission expansion planning** : compute the network development which maximizes social welfare.

## Antares study

In an Antares study, the user builds a power system with a network of zones
characterised by power plants (with their constraints e.g. max power and costs),
power consumption and power transfer between zones (with the import-export transfer capacity and costs).

Antares performs probabilistic simulations of the system
throughout many year-long scenarios made of 8760 hourly
time frames each.
The goal of the Antares simulation is to minimize the
**expected operation cost during one year**.

## Antares-Xpansion simulation

Given an Antares simulation the user can define some
_investment candidates_ in the power network in order to:

- (increase or create) the transfer capacity between areas,
- (increase or create) the maximum power of a generation facility.

Each _investment candidate_ can potentially decrease the variable operational cost
of the power system, but induces an additional **investment annuity** that includes:

- Annualized investment costs to physically build the facility,
- Fixed operational costs and maintenance costs to sustain the operation.

Antares-Xpansion optimizes the _investments_ in order to minimize the global cost, which is the sum of the **expected operation cost during one year** and the **investment annuity**.

Antares-Xpansion is currently under development. Feel free to submit any issue.

## Installation

Antares-Xpansion is currently released as standalone-portable solution.
It can be run either using the single file executable or
an archive including multiple binaries called by a driver.

To download the latest version of Antares-Xpansion, visit the [release page][antares_xpansion_release_url] of Antares-Xpansion repository and download the binary that matches your platform. If you prefer to build the software from the source files, please refer to the [developer guide][developer-guide].

Once you have downloaded the archive, extract the files in the folder of your choice. You are now ready to use Antares-Xpansion. 

To check the installation, you can open a command prompt in the Antares-Xpansion install directory and run the following command to execute one of the examples included in the package:

```shell
antares-xpansion-launcher.exe -i examples\SmallTestFiveCandidates
```

## Getting started

The user should first create an Antares study 
that allows for the definition of investment candidates
(see the [user guide][user-guide] for detailed informations)
and create the `candidates.ini` and `settings.ini` files
in the directory `study_path/user/expansion`.

Since v0.6.0, Antares-Xpansion includes an experimental graphical interface but it is optimally used as a command line prompt. 

### Command-line usage

1.  Open a command prompt in your Antares-Xpansion install directory. By default (on Windows) it is named `antaresXpansion-x.y.z-win64`
where `x.y.z` is the version number.

2.  Run `antares-xpansion-launcher.exe` and choose the path to the
    Antares study with the `-i` parameter. For example, the following command inside the `antares-xpansion-install-dir\` runs one of the examples:
    ```shell
    antares-xpansion-launcher.exe -i examples\SmallTestFiveCandidates
    ```



### Graphical user interface

Antares-Xpansion comes with a GUI. The GUI can be launched by running `antares-xpansion-ui.exe`. For now, this GUI is in the experimental phase.

## Technologies
Antares-Xpansion is developed mainly in **C++** and uses a **Python** runner
to drive the execution of multiple executables.

This software suite has been tested under:

*   Ubuntu 20.04 [![Status][ubuntu_system_svg]][ubuntu_release] 
*   Microsoft Windows with Visual Studio 2019 (64-bit) [![Status][windows_vcpkg_svg]][windows_vcpkg_link]
*   Centos 7 [![Status][centos_system_svg]][centos_system_link] 

Antares-Xpansion is built using CMake.
For build instructions, please visit the [developer guide][developer-guide].
